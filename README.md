# Handwritten Digit Recognition
 This project is a simple implementation of handwritten digit recognition using Python. The goal is to recognize digits (0-9) from images of handwritten digits. This project uses the popular MNIST dataset and leverages machine learning techniques for recognition.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

# Results
After training, the model should achieve high accuracy on the MNIST test dataset. Here are some sample results:

Training Accuracy: ~99%
Test Accuracy: ~98%
